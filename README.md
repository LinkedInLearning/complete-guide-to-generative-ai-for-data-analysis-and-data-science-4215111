## Course Description

GenAI has the potential to enable many more people to work with and analyze data, but to succeed, you need a solid foundation in data management, statistics, and machine learning. This course provides that foundation. Instructor Dan Sullivan teaches how to break down business questions and data science questions into components that can be addressed programmatically and then how to use genAI to create programs and scripts to implement a solution. This course focuses on the three pillars needed to be a successful data analyst or data scientist: problem solving skills, an understanding of statistics and machine learning, and practical experience with data management procedures.
